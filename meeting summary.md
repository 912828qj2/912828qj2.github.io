- Strategy: Micro -> Macro (study the details of every aspects of the  - market and get to understand the logic of the whole market. )
- Investment Products: Commodity -> Bond (to manage cash position) -> Commodity Options -> still to expand.
- Plan for the offshore fund: to replicate strategy of onshore fund to offshore fund. (70% -> 80%), also expend to other investment products in other markets due to the offshore fund nature (20% -> 30%)
- 3 Rules to treat investors fair:
	1. all products share the same strategy, all money of management team is invested in same ratio across products.
	2. PM's own capital is invested in the products as well to better track performance. (1%)
	3. Deferred payment of bonus - 50% 30% 20%

	Guang, Dongbin - Deputy CEO - Marketing

									  -> 2 for Macro

### Offshore fund

#### Key Persons
	Gao, Bin - RO
	Wong, Stephen - Operations
	Siu, Michael - RO - leaving firm soon

#### Important Notes

Offshore firm is named as Invealth Capital at the moment and is being acquired by KF fund onshore firm. Pending SFC to approve.

### Three years Vision

1. AUM 50 Billion RMB - approx. 7 Billion USD
2. Middle Office / Back Office Improvement
3. **Oversea Branches**
4. FX related products potentially
5. Incentive Plan, Shares

## Good Points	
1. KF has good story and philosophy. Wu, Xing believes all the market secrets are hidden in the small details of the market so he requires his research analyst to put effort on studying the market details prior to the direction.
2. KF has solid company structure, internal control and future plan.
3. Their HK entity staffs look solid and experienced.

## What to Improve

1. Wu, Xing currently chairs Management Committee, Investment Committee and Risk Committee. -> We suggest Wu, Xing can stay in Risk Committee but he may better give the chair of Risk Committee to CEO Wong, Dongyang.
2. Trade Execution team and Operations team report to the same boss which we don't think is quite ideal. -> We suggest they split the team into different departments and report to different big bosses.
3.  We suggest HK entity to switch to a more mainstream OMS/PMS system. It may be a challenge to connect the system of onshore firm and offshore firm. We have checked the system that onshore entity is using and it doesn't support any language apart from Chinese. 
4. Currently HK entity is following the HK compliance requirement and onshore entity is following the onshore compliance requirement -> We suggest KF to combine the rules of both onshore and offshore and conclude  a compliance requirements that both entities should apply.
5. Personal Trading Account. KF currently does have rule to check personal trading account to prevent compliance issue or interest conflict while the procedure is kind of simple and rough. However we do understand in Mainland, it is not easy for private company to get the account information directly from the brokers.

## Current Situation

### Basic Information

- AUM 40 Billion CNY, approx. 5 Billion USD.
- They believe as long as big banks are still center of the financial markets, the mispricing will continue and their ability of money making can continue as well.
- Strategy: Macro strategy and their research starts from Top to Bottom.
- Investment Products: Commodity and Fixed Income
- Before 2015, Tang and Zhang both work for performance but since 2015, Zhang started to work as CEO running company's operations.
- LakeFront set the HK branch on 2015 and started to invest heavily in IT and Risk department, Middle and Back office.

### Main Firm and Onshore fund

#### Key persons

```
Tang, Yiting - Founder, Chairman and CIO of onshore entity
Zhang, Yu - Founder and CEO of both onshore and offshore entities
Wang, Xiaodong - Director of Investment and Research
```

#### Structure - Management Committee

```
Tang, Yiting + Zhang, Yu + 11 heads of different departments
```

#### Structure - Investment Committee

```
Tang, Yiting + 4 senior staffs of investement and research department
```

#### Structure - Risk Committee

```
Zhang, Yu + 6 senior staffs of different departements
Risk Committee includes the function of valuation committee
```

### Offshore fund

#### Key Persons

```
Zhang, Yu - CEO, RO of HK entity
Li, Peiyu - CIO (namely), RO of HK entity
Kong, Joe - Opertions Manager, MIC, based in HK
Chen, Qiang (?? did I record the correct name?) - External member of board of director
Zhang, Qiang - 3rd RO of HK entity
```

#### Structure - HK entity

```
1 Compliance
1 Trader
1 Research
2 Operations
1 Marketing

I also noticed there is one more RO in HK entity besides Zhang, Yu and Li, Peiyu, whose name is Zhang, Qiang.
```

#### Important Notes

```
No US investor, so no feeder fund.
```

## Good Points

1. Large AUM - 80 products
2. Good and balanced background of Founders
3. Highly developed and invested (30 Million CNY R&D) IT filtered database for investment and research
4. Stable team - founders know each other for 18 years and most of the senior staffs have been in the team for 10 years

## What to Improve

1. Tang, Yiting is not either CIO or RO of the HK entity. Li, Peiyu is namely the CIO but it is Tang, Yiting or Wang, Xiaodong that are in charge of the investment and research, de facto. And one of the reasons mentioned by LakeFront is Tang, Yiting also serves a semi-official position in AMAC
2. There is only one external member of board of directors for HK entity -> We suggest that replacing Tang, Yiting with another external member would be great. We understand Zhang's background is also accounting and legal, so actually that part is quite balanced.
3. Fund administration currently is Apex -> We suggest it would be better if LakeFront could replace them with either SS&C or Citco given the growing offshore fund AUM. It would be a extra benefit when the fund admin of the underlying fund is the same as the fund admin of the SMA.
4. Very strict internal personal trading account however we suggest they put more details into the rule regarding the "account under control" as the current rule only applies to the account under staff's name.
5. Apparently HK entity is not using a very solid system for OMS and PMS and they have plan to copy the system of Beijing and Shenzhen. We suggest their HK entity could choose a mainstream OMS/PMS system so that it is easy to connect outside counterparties and only need to do one connection between BJ/SZ and HK.
6. I notice LakeFront email system is using Tencent enterprise webmail service which looks very unprofessional and their website building is not professional as well. Of course this is a very minor issue but it may reflects the level of IT team.
