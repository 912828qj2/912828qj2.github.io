## Shenzhen office

1. Qiu Di left the firm at 2017 end with some core members, and they did well in 2018, up 70%. Leaving reason might be disagreement on how to distribute the profit. 2019 down 30%
2. High Turnover of young staffs.

3. CEO Wang is not Investment background. He was a head of managers of CRC in Shenzhen. Wang Dongyang joined KF in 2017. He focused at KF company structure and marketing for 1st year and 2nd year.
4. Investment Committee includes Wu Xing, Gao Bin, Zhang Kun, Wang Wei, Cao Bo, Xiaohui, He Bo.
5. Two issues
   1).  how much risk is under control of Wu Xing - around 50% to 60%. 20% Quant 10% Fixed Income totally out of control of Wu Xing.
   2).  how to sync the investment idea of the whole research team. CEO Wang is not investment back ground, too many research members, and some old staffs under new managers making it more difficult.
