Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as Operations Analyst with CQS. My last day would be 15th February 2020. Before I leave, I will ensure all the work to be done or followed up as possible as I can and I am more than happy to assist in any way to ensure a smooth handover to my placement if there is one assigned.

As you may know, my family is living in Shanghai and I have been working in HK far away from them for almost three years with only a hope that one day they could come, while the hope turns out to be impractical regardless of multiple times of trying and taken the recent situation of HK into consideration it won't be any ideal after all. So we have made such a hard decision of my being back to Shanghai. Weeks ago I was going back to Shanghai as the two kids and some other members suddenly got sick together, that makes me realize I have been absent from my family responsibility for too long and this cannot continue for any longer.

CQS as the firm, and you as mentors have treated me really well since I joined and I truly appreciate the opportunity being handed to me three and half years ago. Thank you very much for everything and I am pretty sure we will stay in touch either in one way or another.
