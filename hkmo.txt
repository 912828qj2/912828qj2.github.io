# Hong Kong Middle Office Tasks
## Daily Tasks
### HK daily trades confirmation / settlement / fails
### DMA daily locate

#### Why

Whenever traders need to sell short a stock, they need to locate the borrow first, which trader shall do it by themselves in APAC. However for DMA trade, trader doesn't know when the trade will be executed, so we send out the daily locate email to make execution broker prepared.

#### How

In the morning, please open TradeSmart to see what is the most updated APAC locate list - and update the daily email to reflect. The email includes some locate list for London trader as well, just keep those.

### David Cook 4.5bps commission update
#### Why
David has some trades under special strategies that our commission table doesn't work for those so that we need to manually adjust.
#### How

In container - trade search - save search -> find "David Cook New 4.5bps Comm Check" -> run the search with updated date, the result should be the trades that need to update the commissions.

### Restricted CCY checking

#### Why

There are some ccy is restricted ccy in APAC, IDR INR THB KRW - whenever there is such amount to settle or received, we need to converted them to USD.

#### How

In container - trade search - save search -> find "Restricted ccy" -> run the search with updated date, the result should be the amount that you need to take care. Always check with PB first.

### NAB fails check

#### Why

NAB fails doesn't flow down to Front automatically, so we need to manually check and update the status.

#### How

NAB (local agent CITI) sends fails in email multiple times a day to both tradeconfirms and sharedsettlements -> check if there is any fails. If there is, open the relevant trade in Front and update the PBstatus to "Failed"

### Daily DVD & CPN posting check

####  Why

Dividend and Coupon postings have been automated however there are still some items to manually check.

#### How

Items to manually check:

1. Preference Stock Dividend

2. US dividend for feeder funds -> tax credit needs to posted

3. Enhanced rate from stock loan team applied correct
4. Dividend or Coupon of TRS position
5. PIK (actually just a reminder)

### BONY file drop

#### Why

BONY CTC files are not automated yet, so need to manually saved down from emails to the folders.

#### How

There are two emails containing two files coming around 2pm to 3:15pm HKT, named "Portfolio Holdings_DD Mmm YYYY.csv" and "Transaction History Report_DD Mmm YYYY.csv". Please save them down first and move to "R:\Middle Office\Operations - Reference\Control\ManualFileDrops"

### NAB file drop

#### Why

NAB daily files are not automated yet, so we need to manually download from the NAB portal and move to folders.

#### How

Please download the daily transactions and position statements from NAB website and drop them in "R:\Middle Office\Operations - Reference\Control\ManualFileDrops"

### Stock loan check - borrow / return

#### Why

1. Most of the ad-hoc trades, Andrew and Kai locates by themselves, but for DMA trade put in TradeSmart, we need to send a daily email to CS to locate.
2. For excess borrow, pay to hold - we need to monitor the email and recap sent by broker and book into system.

#### How

Daily locate email is straight forward, check the daily locate list in TradeSmart everyday and send to CS with the names of other APAC market.

PTH / excess borrow booking is case by case.

Daily stock borrow booking and return if not special name - online borrow report and Front SL return spreadsheet.
